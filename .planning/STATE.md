# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-07-27)

**Core value:** 관찰은 최소화하고 판단과 스킬 변경 권한은 사용자에게 남긴다.
**Current focus:** Phase 5 — Read-only Quality Gate

## Current Position

Phase: 5 of 11 (Read-only Quality Gate)
Plan: 0 of 1 in current phase
Status: Implementation and boundary verification complete; production epoch
`Q-001` is COLLECTING at 0/10 distinct real sessions
Last activity: 2026-07-30 — Phase 5 quality-gate implementation, independent
reviews, 443-test suite, plugin installation and production `Q-001` open complete

Progress: [████░░░░░░] 36%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 4
- Average duration: Not recorded
- Total execution time: Not recorded

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Feasibility Spike | 1/1 | Not recorded | Not recorded |
| 2. Session-Level Capture Design Amendment | 1/1 | Not recorded | Not recorded |
| 3. Runtime Queue | 1/1 | Not recorded | Not recorded |
| 4. Review and Inbox | 1/1 | Not recorded | Not recorded |

**Recent Trend:** Four sequential phase gates recorded; Phase 2, Phase 3 and
Phase 4 are PASS; Phase 5 mechanics are verified and its real cohort is open

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Phase 1 completion means the probe and deterministic report were produced; it does not convert the product gate to PASS.
- Phase 2 retained one global inbox while replacing turn-level and symmetric-write assumptions with session identity, same-file/frozen-prefix binding and asymmetric access.
- CLI와 Desktop 각각 두 independent sessions와 exact-six schema-v2 fixtures가 amended report `PASS`를 입증했다.
- Phase 3 uses only
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-28-skill-evolver-session-runtime-queue.md`
  from the Task 7 lineage: original
  `e8fad084e275896622baeea4ffb9d5580b46104b`, bounded spool/path/init
  hardening `d9d6ef7bdc51ff2f6b3112b824aba9688acb54e0`, and executable portable
  DELETE-journal final `dd9227408d433ed97e5c958bc377920770e0941a`
  (`CLEAN`).
- Phase 3 completion report
  `docs/release-reports/runtime-queue.json` records `PASS`, 12 true checks,
  seven production digests and implementation commit `d7fb9b9`.
- Phase 4 must use session generations and frozen byte boundaries, not required
  turn identity, per-Stop rows or a 20-item batch abstraction.
- Review, evaluation and mutation remain explicit-only; apply/undo require external TTY and complete digest/hash.
- Phase 5 labels are user-entered only in a user-controlled external terminal;
  the agent must not enter or infer them, including through a PTY.
- `Q-001` opened at `2026-07-30T10:15:35Z`; only distinct meaningful Codex
  tasks captured after plugin activation count as real quality evidence.

### Pending Todos

- Collect at least 10 distinct meaningful real Codex sessions in `Q-001`.
- Explicitly review the collected sessions in bounded batches and seal `Q-001`.
- Have the user attest every sealed candidate in an external terminal, then run
  the terminal quality gate and commit its content-addressed PASS report.
- Keep Runner, Prepare, Evaluate and Apply disabled until `QUALITY-01` passes.

### Blockers/Concerns

- No Phase 4 implementation blocker remains: `docs/release-reports/review-inbox.json` records `PASS`.
- Phase 4 PASS proves deterministic mechanics and safety only; candidate quality remains unmeasured until Phase 5.
- Phase 5 cannot use fixtures, subagents, repeated generations in this task, or
  empty generated tasks as substitutes for 10 distinct real sessions.
- Production status at `2026-07-30T10:17:31Z` is `pending_sessions=0`,
  `last_hook_success_at=null`; `Q-001` is `COLLECTING` with 0 sessions,
  0 candidates and 0 labels.
- The original Phase 1 `FAIL` and superseded turn-level Review plan remain immutable historical evidence.

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Runtime | Turn-level queue implementation | Superseded; must not execute | Phase 2 amendment |
| Review | Turn-level/20-item Review plan | Superseded; replaced by completed session-generation Review | Phase 4 |

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-07-30
Stopped at: Phase 5 mechanics complete; Q-001 awaits distinct post-install real
Codex tasks before bounded review, sealing, external-terminal labels and gate
Resume file: None
